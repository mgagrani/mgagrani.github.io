<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I work as a staff research sceintist at [Qualcomm AI research](https://www.qualcomm.com/research/artificial-intelligence/ai-research). I currently work on improving the efficiency of Large Language Models. In particular, I am interested in the efficient inference with LLMs for their deployment on edge. In the past I have worked on Machine Learning for Combinatorial Optimization, Reinforcement Learning and stochastic control. 

I obtained my PhD in Electrical & Computer Engineering from University of Southern California (USC) in 2020 under the supervision of [Dr. Ashutosh Nayyar](https://sites.google.com/usc.edu/ashutosh) and [Dr. Rahul Jain](https://www.rahuljain.net/). Before that, I finished my undergrad in Electrical Engineering from [IIT Kanpur](https://www.iitk.ac.in) in 2013.
